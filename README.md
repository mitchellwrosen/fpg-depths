# The Depths

Casual, single-player strategy game written in Elm.

# User Guide

**Goal**: destroy all the opponent's habitats.

**Gameplay**: Combat only happens at habitats. Units not in combat are invisible to the opponent.

To learn more you'll have to look at the source(!?). I suggest:

* [src/Game/Unit.elm](./src/Game/Unit.elm)
* [src/Game/Building.elm](./src/Game/Building.elm)

If you want to try adding your own units, install `elm-make` (`elmPackages.elm` in Nixpkgs) and run:

```sh
elm-make src/Main.elm --output=./site/main.js --warn --yes
firefox site/index.html
```

Or for live reload and debugging:

* install [elm-live](https://github.com/architectcodes/elm-live)
* run the dev script in the root directory:

```sh
./dev.sh`
```

* open `localhost:8000` in your browser

# Philosophy

One way to make games is to design for elegance. Elegant games have a few well though-out rules that give rise to complex strategies ([Agar.io](http://agar.io/) is a good example of this). This approach is especially well suited for challenging or competitive games.

The philosophy of _The Depths_ is the opposite.

Sometimes you just want a lot of cool options for stuff to build. That's what we'll try to provide.

# Special thanks

* To [@danneu](https://github.com/danneu/elm-hex-grid) for his [elm-hex-grid](https://github.com/danneu/elm-hex-grid) library. _The Depths_ started as a fork of that project's examples. Some of this game's hex board invoking code and CSS is still unchanged from there.
